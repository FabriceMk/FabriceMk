### Hello there 👋

- I am a Full-Stack Developer and Engineering Manager living in Japan 🗾 and passionate about building stuff (especially APIs) in the cloud ⛅

- I have a high affinity with statically and strongly typed languages 💪 so you will see some C#/.NET Core and Typescript around here.

- This Github mainly hosts personal projects to test things I don't have time at work 💻

### 🌱 Current Learnings

- Becoming even better at dealing with humans as a manager 😁 for my engineers to make them grow and become the best.

- I am also motivating myself to start writing tech articles and share my knowledge about technical topcs but also managerial ones.

- Building games on a fantasy console with [Pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php)
