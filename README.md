### Hello there 👋

- I am a Full-Stack Developer and Engineering Manager living in Japan 🗾 and passionate about building stuff (especially APIs) in the cloud ⛅

- I have a high affinity with statically and strongly typed languages 💪 so you will see some **C#/.NET Core** and **Typescript** around here.

- This Github mainly hosts personal projects to test and play with things I don't have time to at work 💻
